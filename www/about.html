            <p class="about-p">
              Drunklandia started as a group project at Epicodus by four aspiring developers who were looking for their next happy hour. However, with the large number of bars in Portland to pick from, it was hard to find one that met all their needs. They wanted to be able to search for local happy hours and filter their results by dietary restrictions, patio seating, and various other categories. Thus, Drunklandia was born. </p>

               I hail from California, where I earned my BA in Communication from Santa Clara University in 2007. After working at Google for several years, I decided to switch gears. I spent a winter in Lake Tahoe, snowboarding and blogging daily, then traveled through Thailand for a few weeks before moving to Portland in 2013. I currently live in Vancouver, WA and have spent the last few years working primarily as a lash and makeup artist in the Portland area. Though I love the beauty industry, I'm looking forward to unleashing my creativity on the tech world. My one-year-old daughter Cloa is my muse, my daily dose of sunshine, and the cleverest tiny human I know! <br>

               My name is Jared Eiseman. I am an aspiring web developer and current student of Epicodus. I live in Vancouver, Washington with my roommate and his cat. On the weekends you would be able to find me either working in a local game store, singing karaoke with friends, or binge watching movies and TV shows with my roommates cat, Boogeyman. After over 15 years of being a hobbyist, only to have my passion for web development grow with every morsel of learning I have decided to take the step of making a career switch into he web development and design industry. I am excited for this new endeavor.<br>

                I was born in Bend, Oregon on June 1st (Gemini!) and have been back and forth between Bend and the Portland area ever since. I am a huge animal lover, but frogs are my all time favorite. Hiking, photography, rainy days, avocados, and scary movies are a few of my favorite things, and I have a not-so-guilty pleasure of binging on terrible reality TV shows (I'm talking the really bad ones). More recently I have started going to Buddhist meditation sessions every weekend, and I try to meditate at least once every day. It is a practice that I have found really helps clear my mind, which has come in at Epicodus where I feel I am stuffing my brain with a ton of information all day!<br>

               I graduated from DePaul University with a BSB in Honors Economics. A few years later I moved out to Portland, Oregon to work in eCommerce but quickly realized I was much more interested in designing websites rather than managing them. Now I am studying CSS and Web Design at Epicodus. When I'm not working or in school I love watching dumb comedy videos on Youtube or playing RPGs like Skyrim and The Sims. I'm also a huge fan of podcasts and documentaries about weird things like aliens, cults, serial killers, and conspiracy theories.  But my little black cat Jerry is my favorite thing in the universe. <br>
